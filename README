PRE RUN:
Front-end:
Install android studio
install flutter and set up the emulator at version 9 API-28 (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

in terminal of the IDE, run:
flutter pub add cloud_firestore
flutter pub add http
flutter pub add modal_progress_hud_nsn
flutter pub add flutter_speed_dial
flutter pub add flutter_barcode_scanner

packages dependencies:
cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
cloud_firestore: ^2.2.0
http: ^0.13.3
modal_progress_hud_nsn: ^0.1.0-nullsafety-1
flutter_speed_dial: ^3.0.5
flutter_barcode_scanner: ^2.0.0


To open the emulator go to the AVD manager. Then hit run in the IDE to open the app in the emulator.
By default, if you run the flask server and emulator on the same computer, the http requests will work
without any change (default ip 10.0.2.2). if you run them on different machine you need to configure the ip in main.dart
and possibly change the server's network router firewall so it accepts entering initiating (syn) http requests.
if you dont have access to your router's firewall, just run the server and emulator on the same pc.
